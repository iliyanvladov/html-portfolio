<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm a motivated person who believes in pushing through challenges and never
  giving up. In just two years, I went from having no experience or industry
  knowledge to earning one of the top roles in Software Support at my company.
  When I started, I didn’t know even the language, didn’t have experience, but I
  had a lot of determination to figure out where I wanted to go in my career.

  Along the way, I explored a lot of paths. I tried design, which was
  interesting but not quite the right fit. I liked programming, and I still plan
  to explore it more as I need it, but it was Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking
  that truly clicked for me. Right now, I'm a student at SoftUni, focusing on
  Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking, and I'm taking a couple of courses (two of
  them completed with excellent grades) to build the skills I need. In addition,
  I completed a course in Linux System Administration and am teaching myself
  Networking Essentials. Since AI is becoming a bigger part of both our daily
  lives and our work, I’m diving into AI in Action for a better grasp of this
  field, too. Once I wrap up my courses, I plan to keep going with platforms
  like TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and Udemy.

  Outside of work, I enjoy building simple websites and online shops. On the
  personal side, I’m a husband and a proud dad, and technology has always been
  part of my life. It’s something that fascinated me from a young age and
  continues to be a big part of who I am today.
